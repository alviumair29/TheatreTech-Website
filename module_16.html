    <h1>Module 16 - This Image Does Not Exist</h1>

    <h2>Original Image:</h2>

        <strong>Description of the original image:</strong><br>
        This is an image taken from a scene in the movie Thor: Ragnarok and set in the fictional land of Asgard. It shows Thor (The Protagonist) going up against her sister Hela's (The Antagonist) army of warriors in the final battle of the movie. The tone is serious and there are dark blue clouds. There is a bridge in which the enemies are present, and it can be seen that Thor is flying down and using his ability to strike lightning and thunder in order to approach the enemies. That is the component that I consider to be manipulated in this image. I believe that the producers used the aspect of CGI and 3D graphics to showcase the lightning. Also, since it is a superhero sci-fi based movie, it makes sense to use such effects.

        <strong>Description from AI tool:</strong><br>
        This is a stylized, cinematic image depicting a dynamic scene from a futuristic or science fiction setting. The focus is on a figure in a superhero-like pose, flying through the air, surrounded by vibrant blue lightning bolts against a dramatic sunset sky with hues of purple, pink, and blue. Below the figure, there is an army of armored warriors with weapons drawn, standing on a platform with glowing neon blue and green lines. The warriors appear to be preparing for battle or defending against an unseen threat. The overall mood is intense and suggests an epic confrontation. The image conveys a sense of power, action, and otherworldly conflict. The visual style is reminiscent of high-budget CGI found in modern action movies or video games.

        Tech spec: Size: 1400x653 pixels; Camera angle: Low angle shot, looking up towards the figure; Lighting: Backlit with ambient sunset light and additional artificial lighting highlighting the figure and the warriors; Resolution: Appears to be high due to the clarity of details and textures.

    <h2>Compare and Contrast:</h2>
    <p>
        Comparing the two generated images, I think the one generated through my description feels closest to the original. This is because my description mentions and showcases that Thor is present in the image whereas in the AI description, there is no mention or image of Thor. Also, the AI description lacks the fighting aspect of the image. It just shows the character rather than him engaging in battle. My description also showcases Asgard in a better and more realistic nature than the AI's description and it also shows Thor fighting his enemies.
